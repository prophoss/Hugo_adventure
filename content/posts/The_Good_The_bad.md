###  The Good The bad and The Ugly  
Over the past couple of weeks my life has taken an interesting turn. I hurt my knee, and just recently we had a bout of food poisoning that everyone is getting over. My knee has not really gotten better as we have gone along, but it has not gotten worse, per se. This may turn out to be a longer story, my knee that is, than I had hoped for. I had an MRI done today so I should knwo more come friday when I see the doctor again.  

On a second and more fun note I just ordered an [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) uno clone which Is a single board computer. Now with this kit I can do a bunch of stuff that might bore some people to tears, but excite others. It is all about electronics and embedded programing which I think is pretty cool. This kit is a copy of the original which is open source with a bunch of things added to allow you to create different projects by attaching wires and components to the board. Then programing the to do sometihng. There are a ton of [projects](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub) out there to try many that are way too complicated for me right now, but man they look cool!  

Third the ugliest scene of all was our family bout with food poisioning. That was terrible. We have narrowed it down to the Mcdonalds we ate becasue everyone who ate it got sick but the one who didn't, well didn't get sick. So beware out there. The child who is the picky eater was spared the pain and suffering and reported it online on our behalf, so thanks for that. As always life goes on, but missing yet more days from work is not good. I need to get back to working some good hours again. Still we are trusting God through all this and look forward to watching Him do His thing as He always does. In the mean time school draws ever closer. So keep us in your prayers.
