It's been an adventure so far just like my heading. So many things aren't exactly explained like I'd like them to be. It seems like I have to ask somebody to hold my hand the whole way. I wish I could figure this stuff out myself. The Docs aren't bad it just all seems out of sync as I go through cherry picking each piece as I run into problems. Now that is more my fault than any thing to do with the docs but I just wish the problems I run into were more inline with the docs. That way I could just work each problem one by one till I have the kind of site I'd like. With out all the back and forth  between the same docs over and over again. Don't mean to complain so much that is not my intention. Having said that if I can figure out all this I'm gonna put togther a tutorial and or blog to help others along the way.
