Well it happened! I hurt myself whie delivering pizza. I know what you mighth be thinking. How exactly did you do that? Well it's not as hard as it may seem. I stepped half on half off a curb and I leaned the worng way and so did my knee. I was wearing my knee brace. My knees have been giving me trouble becasue of some arthritis in there. The brace did keep it from hurting worse than it might have. I hate that it happened, but not neccesarily when it did. It has been kind of nice to be off a few days and right at christmas. Which is the good and the bad of it. I am missing out on some good money at this time of year. It'll be alright though.   
School is getting closer and I have been getting emails from the teachers about classes. Also while I am off I have been advancing my knowledge of golang. KInd of neat to learn about what seems to be a web crawler I'm guessing. I noticed that in one of my classes we will be learninig python! I'm already familiar with python so hopefully that will help. The rest is well all new.
