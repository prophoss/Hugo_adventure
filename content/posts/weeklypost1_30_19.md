Well I've been sick this week. I had some sort of upper respiratory thing going on. Had to miss a couple of days because of it and now my wife has it too. Not much fun. Having said that I am narrowing down what I hope to do after I graduate. I am looking in to EE and CE as a possible career goal. I talked with a professor at DeVry and found out about what they offer there. I found out that it is a technology degree which is very different from a traditional engineering degree. There is less theory in a tech degree, but more hands-on type stuff. They even do a capstone project that shows a company what you are capable of doing.  Usually an engineering technology degree is an associates degree and therefore of less value in the eyes of hiring managers. I’m not sure if there would be a stigma attached to the technology degree despite the fact that it is an ABET accredited course and a bachelors degree at that. I really like the idea of learning Electrical or Computer engineering degree, but I do want one that will help me. I need more info about how that sort of thing is perceived in the industry. It may be the best way to do what I want to do and I might just go for it anyways. It does give me pause though.
