I finally got to the end of the first round of classes at DeVry. I have done good so far keeping up with my class work. MY gardes are good and it hasn't been too bad. It is a lot of work sure but not so that I can't keep up. I'm sure it will get harder, especially when I start in on th emath calsses, but I will continue to do my best. 

Since I have a week off bewteen calsses I will do some work on my site to clean up the colors and make it look a bit nicer. I would like to add some functionality too it as well but that might take a bit more time than I have I have at the moment. I usually have to do some research to figure out what the docs and youtube videos make look simple. It's all apart of learning I guess,   

I am also attempting to learn how to program microcontrollers. I have downloaded atmel studio 7 which is better than visual studio IDE for doing this. My arduino has aan atmel 328 on it. I could use the arduino IDE but I want to do some thims without the shortcuts it uses. Arduino has it's own library of shortcuts that make it really easy to write code. These shortcuts were written by someone else then are implimented by calling a variable for insatnce keyboard.h that tells it you are using a keyboard and then you just tell it in an array form what goes where. That way it knows what key you are using when you push it. I want to learn how to do things without using the short cuts. If , Good Lord willing, I ever get a job as an embedded programmer I will not be able to use those short cuts unless I'm working on an arduino. The arduino is only one of thousands of micros out there.
