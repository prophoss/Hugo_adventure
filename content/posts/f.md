Things are very interesting right now. Work is very busy right now. A little too busy if you ask me, but that is the nature of pizza delivery business. Right now we are short handed, as usual. Things will change after the first of the year both in business and I'll be starting school too. It will have to change. I'm hoping that my school work won't be too much with my work schedule the way it is. As I recall though things slow down after the first of the year. This will work to my advantage but will also cut into my income too. I'm not so worreid about that as much as maybe I should be, but God has been providing for us here lately, and I doubt He'll stop just because the date changes. Time is my main concern. Time is the most valuable thing I have to deal with or the lack there of.   
I guess it's just the not knowing how things are gonna go. There are a bunch of questions yet to be answered, and that leaves me wondering. To be honest I don't like wondering. I'd much rather know. Ufortunatley it doesn't ususaly work that way. God doesn't usualy show us everything up front. We just learn as we go how things are gonna be. So that is how I'll do it, but until then I guess I'll feel a bit nervous as I continue to learn to trust God, and continue to learn that His grace is sufficient for me too.
