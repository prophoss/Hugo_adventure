I got a new toy yesteday evening! I got an arduino clone kit. There is a lot t o you can do with this kit. To much to explain here, but some highlights are using led's and a potentiometer(pot). I blinked an led, faded it, and controled how fast it flashed using a pot. Was really kind of neat. As a part of the process you not only build the circut by using jumper wires resistors and the like, but you also program the board to tell it what to do! There are digital pins and analog pins, ground, 5v, 3.3v outputs. You tell it which pin to send a signal to and for how long. How intense  the light/power should be and for how long too. It all results in the flashing led. This is electronics but it is also using programing called embeded programing. The combitnation of the two lands somewhere close to electrical engineering, but there is a whole lot more involved  when you get into that aspect of it. I've been learninig a lot here lately : )
