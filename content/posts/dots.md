To be honest I'm not sure what to put here. Do I have to blog? No, but there is a lot to say. Mainly I wanted to connect the dots a little as to why I blog what I do. My hugo adventure is exactly that but it is not just about hugo the web framework. It is how I am getting all this out there though. Which is partly why I called it what I did. This has been an adventure and it is just begging. School starts soon and work will continue. I am dealing with a knee injury that I'm hoping will get back to normal soon. Life as always goes on. No matter what life will go on it's just what happens along the way, and that is what this blog is all about.
