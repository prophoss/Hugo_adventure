 I am going to attempt to keep up with the site this time. I will probably delete some things and try and add something every week or so. This will be a kind of repository that will act as a portfolio of a sort for future job applications. Aside from actually creating my own website I want to show some of the projects we are doing in class. I will consider this a kind of rest as it were. Here we go!
