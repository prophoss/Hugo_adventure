<h1>Scratch Projet</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Welcome</strong> to my scartch game web page. In this game the cat will be chasing 
      a bug as cats often do!<br> The background is a forest. It has
       <font color= "green"> green </font> and <font color="blue">blue</font> colors in it.
       with trees and bushes. Great places for the beattle to hide! <br>
       <ul> In this program there is a :
         <li>repeat loop</li>
         <li>use of the arrow keys</li>
         <li>size adjustments</li>
         <li>and the ability to click on a flag to start the game. </li>
       </ul>
