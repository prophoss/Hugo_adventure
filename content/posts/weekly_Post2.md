## Weekly Post 1-20-19

This week in my life has been another interesting one. The biggest thing during this week was learning more about Eletrical Engineering, and electricty in general. I have been thinking very hard about making EE my degree plan instead of web development. There will be a lot more math and other higher end sciences. It does make me nervous. I can't help but wonder if I can handle the math. I'm not actually that bad at it, but it ain't easy. Still I think if I am willing to go for it I will find a way to do it, and that is the thing! What if I do get an Engineering degree? How cool would that be? It would be a good job that should pay well. If I can add programmimng to that, a thing called embedded engineering, would be even better! I have to admit. It is the programing that I really like about that.   

I have been playing with my arduino kit. I have enjoyed using the LEDs and the serial monitor for interaction. I have created a few programs that are my own and not just pre-made sketches. I created two using one LED and found a way to count how times it blinked. I also found a way to have it count up to 20 blinks and stop. After that I added another LED and programed it to blink one then the other in sequence. The red LED would light up then the green as the red went out. Then the red again as the green went out, and so on. I was pretty proud of that. This is embedded programing at its simplest.

As I was learnng all about the basics of electricity this week I learned quite a bit. I have re-done wires and things like that myself. I have watched others work on stuff on the presses. I had never actually understood how it all worked. Now I understand what a circut is and how eletricity flows along a wire and how. I learned about transistors, diodes, and resistors. I also learned about logic gates. That is what makes up microprocessors that are what allow computers programs to do what they do. It is quite a bit to learn, but I think I can do it. I have time to make any decision on my degree plan. I will be praying about this.
